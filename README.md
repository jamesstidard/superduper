Shell scripts and Keyboard Maestro macros for using the excellent Mac app SuperDuper


* ***2013-09-19:*** [mount-or-unmount-for-superduper.sh](mount-or-unmount-for-superduper.sh) - I wrote this script [awhile ago](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5090) and someone recently asked for it, so I dug it out and posted it here. *(Warning: I haven't used this myself for awhile, as I have a different solution now, so test it carefully.)*

I plan to add to this repo in the near future and/or as time allows.
